    <p>William B. Montgomery is a painter and printmaker who lives near Elgin, Texas.  Born and raised in Tyler, Texas, he studied art at the Kansas City Art Institute and the University of New Mexico.  While studying at the Academia di Belle Arti de Perugia in Italy, he developed an interest in classical European painting which had a major influence on both his painting technique as well has his approach to subject matter.  A life long fascination with nature is a continuing influence and his current work explores animals and their environments, particularly their convergence with civilization. </p>
    <p>Montgomery is also an accomplished printmaker. His twin interests in natural history and traditional etching techniques contribute to skilled and sometimes humorous prints, mainly of Texas and its residents. His scientifically precise etchings of snakes have appeared on the covers of a number of important herpetology books.</p>
    <p>Montgomery recently completed a series of paintings about the Nueces River, as part of a book he collaborated on with his wife, author and artist <a href="http://www.margiecrisp.com/" target="_blank">Margie Crisp</a>.  In 2020 Montgomery completed two paintings which will be featured in the upcoming book, The Art of Texas Parks (to be published by the Texas A&#38;M University Press in fall of 2022) and the traveling exhibits celebrating the Centennial of the Texas State Park System.</p>
