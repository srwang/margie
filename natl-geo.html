      <p>Yeap, that was me.</p>
      <p>In the fall of 1982 I was working for the US Forest Service in Highlands, North Carolina.  A photographer from National Geographic stopped by the ranger station one day to inquire if they knew anyone crazy enough to go swimming in icy river water on a brisk autumn day.  The immediate response was, according to rumor, unanimous.  A few days later I met with the photographer, Steve Wall, and with a half dozen other swimmers, we hiked our way to a series of spring fed pools at the headwaters of the Chattooga River.  The photo that was used in the magazine was one of many terrific photos taken by Steve that day. </p>
      <p>I didn&rsquo;t know the photo had been included in the article (I had signed a release so I knew there was a chance it would be used) until I started receiving letters.  All addressed to &ldquo;Margie Crisp, Highlands, NC.&rdquo;  I was amazed they got to me.  In the end I received over a hundred letters including several job offers and a surprising number of marriage proposals.  I didn&rsquo;t follow up on any of the offers&mdash;job or marriage&mdash;but instead got my GED, went to Southwestern Technical College in Sylva, NC and then on to the University of Texas at Austin for a BFA. </p>
      <p>All in all, having my photo in National Geographic has been a positive part of my life.  Especially now that I&rsquo;m getting, um, mature.  My VERY best friends say I haven&rsquo;t changed a bit.  Yeah.</p>
      <p>Cheers,<br>
